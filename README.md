## Opioid Analysis

# Project Descriptions/outline

Our group is looking to find trends related to the opioid crisis in the United States. We are looking to find geographical, gender, age and race trends. We will use two different data sets to find this information, while ensuring we don't connect them.

We are also curious to see how the trends we find can inform solutions, like NARCAN need in different areas most affected.

# Datasets to be Used

# Research Questions to Anwser

1. What trends does the data show? Are there year-to-year changes?
2. What are the demographics of the overdoses? Age, gender, etc.
3. Where are the the highest overdoses per drug?
4. Who is most at risk for overdose of each drug type?
